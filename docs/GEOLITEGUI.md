to avoid access issues. Use the following permissions as a reference:

```bash
root@your-system:/var/www/openroaming/docs/geoLiteDB# ls -la
total 57464
drwxrwxr-x 2 root root     4096 Feb 18 11:48 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root     4096 Feb 18 12:08 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root        0 Feb 18 11:35 .gitkeep
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 58827769 Feb 14 13:10 GeoLite2-City.mmdb
```

### Key Points for File Permissions:

- The directory (**geoLiteDB**) has permissions `drwxrwxr-x`, which allows read, write, and execute access for the owner
  and group, but only read and execute access for others.
- The `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` file has permissions `-rw-rw-r--`, which allows read and write access for the owner and
  group, and read-only access for others.

To apply these permissions, you can run:

```bash
chmod 775 /var/www/openroaming/docs/geoLiteDB
chmod 664 /var/www/openroaming/docs/geoLiteDB/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
```

Ensure the file and directory ownership matches your system's requirements, typically the user running the web server.
