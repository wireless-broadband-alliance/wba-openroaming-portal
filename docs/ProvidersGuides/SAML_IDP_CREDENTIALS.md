# ðŸ”’ SAML Specific Settings

Follow these steps to set up the **SAML Service Provider (SP)** and **Identity Provider (IdP)** properly:

---

## Step 1: Obtain the IdP Details
1. Contact your **Identity Provider (IdP)** administrator or refer to their documentation to gather the necessary details:
    - **IdP Entity ID**: The unique identifier for the IdP (usually a URI).
    - **IdP SSO URL**: The URL of the IdP's Single Sign-On Service endpoint.
    - **IdP X509 Certificate**: The certificate used by the IdP to sign SAML responses.

2. Ensure you have access to the IdP's administrative portal to manage connections or application configurations, if necessary.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your SAML Service Provider (SP)
1. Identify your application's SAML **SP Entity ID** and **SP ACS URL**:
    - **SP Entity ID**: The unique identifier for your Service Provider (usually a URI).
    - **SP ACS URL**: The endpoint in your application to process SAML assertions from the IdP (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/saml/acs`).

2. Configure these values in your IdP's settings to establish a trust relationship with your application:
    - Add a new **SAML Application** in the IdP portal.
    - Provide the **SP Entity ID** and **SP ACS URL** as required.

## Step 3: Obtain and Store the Required Variables
In your application's `.env` file (or in a `config/secrets` service if used), define the following variables:

```dotenv
# Identity Provider (IdP) Configuration
SAML_IDP_ENTITY_ID=your_idp_entity_id
SAML_IDP_SSO_URL=https://idp.sso.endpoint
SAML_IDP_X509_CERT=your_idp_x509_certificate

# Service Provider (SP) Configuration
SAML_SP_ENTITY_ID=your_sp_entity_id
SAML_SP_ACS_URL=https://yourdomain.com/saml/acs
```

### Example:
- **SAML_IDP_ENTITY_ID**: `https://idp.example.com/entity_id`
- **SAML_IDP_SSO_URL**: `https://idp.example.com/sso`
- **SAML_IDP_X509_CERT**: The Base64-encoded X509 certificate provided by your IdP.
- **SAML_SP_ENTITY_ID**: `https://yourapp.example.com/sp_entity_id`
- **SAML_SP_ACS_URL**: `https://yourapp.example.com/saml/acs`

---

## Step 4: Test the SAML Integration
1. Ensure that both the SP and IdP configurations match in your application and the IdP portal.
2. Use a test account from the IdP to log in to your application and verify the SAML SSO functionality.
3. Monitor SAML assertion logs for debugging, if necessary.

These variables enable the SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) integration for your application. Make sure these values are accurate and securely managed.
