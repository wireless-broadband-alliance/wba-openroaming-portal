# üåêÔ∏é OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal

Welcome to the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal! This repository provides a **reference implementation designed to
baseline the industry** on the necessary components for developing an enabler component of OpenRoaming.

## Why it was created?

The primary objective of the **OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal is to simplify the provisioning of identities using
Passpoint**, enabling an OpenRoaming network to support seamless Wi-Fi connectivity and enhance security for users
across various environments.

The goal is to **provide secure Wi-Fi access to everyone** without the need for repeated logins or unsecure/open
networks, making Wi-Fi connectivity for individuals and enterprises easier, quicker, and more user-friendly.

## How it works?

OpenRoaming is an **open standard developed to enable global, secure, and automatic Wi-Fi connectivity**. With
OpenRoaming, users can connect to Wi-Fi networks without being prompted for login credentials. Instead, it utilizes
digital certificates and secure authentication mechanisms to **ensure a seamless and secure connection experience**.
This technology allows users to quickly switch between Wi-Fi networks‚Äîsuch as public hotspots, venues, residencies,
corporate networks, and other places‚Äîwithout delays or multiple logins.

Each user is provided with a unique and secure profile that caters to their specific needs and preferences. The
OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal simplifies the setup and configuration process for network administrators, acting as a
key enabler for OpenRoaming technology.

# Portal Overview & Baseline Operation

The objective is for the user to get familiarized with the project and its baseline features.

## Platform Mode (Demo or Live)

The project provides two modes: Platform mode set to **DEMO** or **LIVE**, each serving to different needs.

- **Platform Mode (Demo)**: When platform mode is set to DEMO, the system generates demo profiles based on the submitted
  email.
  This allows users to explore and test the portal's functionality without the need to create a user account. In demo
  mode, only "demo login" is displayed, and SAML and other login methods are disabled, regardless of other settings. A
  demo warning is also displayed, indicating that the system is in demo mode. **PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
  This mode can't be used because externally due to legal implications in this type of environment.

When this mode is activated, **it's not required** to verify the user account several times.

- **Platform Mode (Live)**: When platform mode is set to LIVE, profiles are generated based on
  individual user accounts inside the project. This offers a completely customized and secure Wi-Fi experience adapted
  to the interests and needs of each user. Users can set up accounts in production mode and use all available login
  methods, including SAML and Google authentication.

When this mode is activated, **it's required** to verify the account every time the user wants to download a profile
again, because it's a new demo account being generated on the portal.

  Examples:
    ```dotenv
    # This are just a examples, please DO NOT USE IT
    # Example 1: Sending emails via SMTP (e.g., Gmail)
    MAILER_DSN=smtp://user:password@smtp.gmail.com:587?encryption=tls&auth_mode=login

    # Example 2: Using the default email transport (using PHP's mail() function)
    MAILER_DSN=mail://default
    ```
