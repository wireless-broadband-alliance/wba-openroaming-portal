## Getting Started - Setup Guide
In this guide, we'll lead you through the setup of the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal step by step.

To understand how it works, you'll get basic knowledge behind each stage. You will possess a fully working automatic device authentication for your wireless networks by the end of this guide. Let's get started! üöÄ

### Prerequisites:
- Docker (required for running the application)
- Docker-compose (required for managing multiple containers)
- Node Js - 16 or higher (required for building front-end assets)
- Git (optional, if you prefer to clone the repository)


### How to get the Project
You have two options to get the project:
1. **Download Release Package**: Download the release package from the releases section on GitHub. This package contains only the required components to run the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal, including `.env.sample`, `docker-compose.yml`, and other necessary files.


2. **Clone the Repository**: If you're familiar with Git and want to access the complete source code, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
- git clone <repository-url>
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Please follow the instructions below, on the root folder of the project, to prepare it:

1. **Update Environment Variables**: After you have obtained the project, make sure to update your environment variables. A sample file named `.env.sample` is provided in the project root directory. Duplicate the sample file and rename it to `.env`. You can then modify the environment variables to match your specific configuration. üóùÔ∏è

**Note**: When updating the database credentials in the `.env` file, make sure they **match the credentials specified in the docker-compose.yml** file. Failure to match the credentials may result in the application being unable to connect to the database.

2. **Build and Start Services**: Use Docker to build and start the necessary services. Execute the following command: üê≥

```bash
- docker-compose up -d
```
3. **Check Container Status**: After executing the previous command, ensure that all containers for each service are appropriately formed. The following command may be used to verify the status of each container, example:

```bash
- docker ps
```

‚áì After you create the containers they should look like this. ‚áì

```bash
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_mailcatcher_1 ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_web_1         ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_memcached_1   ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_mysql_1       ... done
```
4. **Upload Certificates**: Upload your certificate files to the `signing-keys` directory for the portal generates profiles based on your certificates.

5. **Generate PFX Signing Key**: Now, inside the `web` container, go to the tools directory and run the generatePfx script by doing this:

```bash
- docker exec -it <web-container-id> bash
- cd tools
- sh generatePfxSigningKey.sh
```

6. **Migrations, Fixtures and Permissions**: Still inside of the`web` container, you need to run this 3 commands to load the database schema, load is respective settings and add permissions to a specific folder to save images:

```bash
- php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
- php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
- chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/openroaming/public/resources/uploaded/
```

**IMPORTANT**: After you load the fixtures by running the second command, you need to change the following environment variable:

`RADIUS_TRUSTED_ROOT_CA_SHA1_HASH`: The SHA1 hash of your RADIUS server's trusted root CA. The default value is set to the SHA1 hash of the LetsEncrypt CA.

This number is needed to validate the RADIUS server's certificate. If you use a different CA for your RADIUS server, you must replace this value with the SHA1 hash of your CA's root certificate. **Connections errors** can happen if the right SHA1 hash is not provided.

Make sure to check the `SettingFixture.php` file for any reference about the default data and check the migrations about the database on the migrations folder of the project.

### üõë Important Security Notice after Installation üõë

**It is critical to change the application to "prod"** mode before exposing the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal to the internet or any production environment. Running the portal in "dev" mode on a public network **could reveal vital information and debug logs to possible attackers**, providing serious risks for security.

## Congratulations! üéâ
You've successfully completed the installation process of the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal. üöÄ

Now, it's time to access your fully set up portal! üåê

## üöß Troubleshooting
Here are some probable troubleshooting issues you may experience during the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal installation:

1. **Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables**: Check if you don't forget to update the environment variables in the `.env` file. Make sure you have carefully followed the instructions to duplicate the `.env.sample` file and update the necessary variables with the correct values.
2. **Docker Compose Errors**: Docker Compose may encounter problems if your system setup or Docker version does not meet the prerequisites. Check if you have the latest Docker and Docker Compose versions installed.
3. **Container Not Running**: If you encounter errors while checking container status with `docker ps` command, it could indicate that the containers did not start correctly. Make sure you have followed the installation steps correctly and have the necessary permissions to run Docker containers. Don't forget to check if you don't have any container using the same ports necessary to run this project.
4. **DevMode instead of Production**: It's essential to switch the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal to Production Mode (prod) when deploying it on the internet. Running the portal in Development Mode (dev) can lead to security vulnerabilities and suboptimal performance. Again please gou check your `.env` file and change it to prod.
5. **Generate Pfx-Signing-Key**: If you get a **Permission denied** error while trying to run the script, you have to grant executable permissions to the script file before executing it.

To solve this, use the chmod command inside the `web` container, to give the script executable rights.
```bash
- docker exec -it <web-container-id> bash
- chmod +x tools/generatePfxSigningKey.sh

# How it Looks and How it Works?
Now we will show how the project looks, and give you some base information about how it works.

## Production Mode && Demo Mode

The project provides two modes: demo mode set to **TRUE** or **FALSE**, each serving to different needs.

- **Demo Mode (TRUE)**: When demo mode is set to TRUE, the system generates demo profiles based on the submitted email. This allows users to explore and test the portal's functionality without the need to create a user account. In demo mode, only "demo login" is displayed, and SAML and other login methods are disabled, regardless of other settings. A demo warning is also displayed, indicating that the system is in demo mode.

When this mode is activated **it's required** to verify the account every time the user want to download a profile again, because it's a new demo account being generated on the portal.
- **Production Mode (FALSE)**: On the other hand, when demo mode is set to FALSE, profiles are generated based on individual user accounts inside the project. This offers a completely customized and secure Wi-Fi experience adapted to the interests and needs of each user. Users can set up accounts in production mode and use all available login methods, including SAML and Google authentication.

When this mode is activated **it's not required** to verify the user account several time.
