Let's get started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Node Js - 16 or higher
- Composer
- Git (if you prefer to clone the repository)

## How to get the Project
You have two options to get the project:
1. **Download Zip File**: You can download the project as a zip file and extract it to a directory on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**: If you're familiar with Git, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
- git clone <repository-url>
```
## Installation Commands
Please follow the instructions below, on the root folder of the project, to prepare and install it:

1. **Update Environment Variables**: After you have obtained the project, make sure to update your environment variables. A sample file named `.env.sample` is provided in the project root directory. Duplicate the sample file and rename it to `.env`. You can then modify the environment variables to match your specific configuration. üóùÔ∏è
2. **Install Dependencies**: Before starting the project, you need to install its dependencies. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal to install the required packages:
```bash
- yarn build
```
3. **Build and Start Services**: Use Docker to build and start the necessary services. Execute the following command: üê≥

```bash
- docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
4. **Check Container Status**: After executing the previous command, ensure that all containers for each service are appropriately formed. The following command may be used to verify the status of each container, example:

```bash
- docker ps
```

‚áì Finally after you create the containers, they should look like this. ‚áì

```bash
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_mailcatcher_1 ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_web_1         ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_memcached_1   ... done
Starting cc-openroaming-provisioning-web_mysql_1       ... done
```

## Post Installation
Congratulations on finishing the essential requirements üéâ! Now we need to get the project up and running.

1. **Access the web Container**: To make adjustments to the project, you'll need to access the `web` container. Type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
- docker exec -it <web-container-id> bash
```
2. **Composer Install**: Once inside the `web` container, use the composer install command to install all the required PHP dependencies for the project. Composer will read the composer.json file and download the necessary packages into the vendor directory.
```bash
- composer install
```
3. **NPM Run Build**: Use Node Package Manager (NPM) to build the frontend assets when running npm run build command. This instruction tells Webpack to bundle and generate the JavaScript, CSS, and other needed¬†assets. The created files will be saved in the build directory.
```bash
- npm run build
```
4. **Set Up Database Schema**: After that, run the migration command to set up your database schema:

```bash
- php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

5. **Load Initial Data**: Now we'll populate the database with the requested configuration data. This data it's¬†located in "src/DataFixtures/SettingFixture.php". Execute it use¬†the following command:

```bash
- php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

## üöß Troubleshooting
Here are some probable troubleshooting issues you may experience during the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal installation:

1. **Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables**: Check if you don't forget to update the environment variables in the `.env` file. Make sure you have carefully followed the instructions to duplicate the `.env.sample` file and update the necessary variables with the correct values.
2. **Node.js Version Compatibility**: You can face problems during the yarn build step if you have an older version of Node.js installed on your machine. Make sure you have the correct version of Node.js installed. Version 16 or higher is required.
3. **Docker Compose Errors**: Docker Compose may encounter problems if your system setup or Docker version does not meet the prerequisites. Check if you have the latest Docker and Docker Compose versions installed.
4. **Container Not Running**: If you encounter errors while checking container status with `docker ps` command, it could indicate that the containers did not start correctly. Make sure you have followed the installation steps correctly and have the necessary permissions to run Docker containers. Don't forget to check if you don't have any container using the same ports necessary to run this project.
5. **Database Connectivity**: Database connectivity issues could happen you provide the incorrect database credentials or set up the database URL incorrectly. Check if you have the right database connection data in your `.env` file.
6. **Missing Node.js Packages**: During the npm run build step, you might encounter errors if you have not installed all the required Node.js packages. Ensure that you have run `yarn install` to install the required packages before executing `npm run build` on the `web` container.
7. **Composer Dependency Issues**: If you face issues during the `composer install` step that means Composer found problems while installing PHP dependencies. Check you have the necessary PHP version and extensions installed.
8. **Database Migration Errors**: If you have problems with database migrations, it may be due to database schema conflicts or other migration-related issues. To verify any related problems with migrations, go to the terminal and use the following commands to check the respective logs of the `web` container.
```bash
- docker ps
- docker logs <container-web-id>
```
