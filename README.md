# How it Looks and How it Works?

Now we will show how the project looks, and give you some base information about how it works.

## Platform Mode Demo or Live

The project provides two modes: Platform mode set to **DEMO** or **LIVE**, each serving to different needs.

- **Platform Mode (Demo)**: When platform mode is set to DEMO, the system generates demo profiles based on the submitted
  email.
  This allows users to explore and test the portal's functionality without the need to create a user account. In demo
  mode, only "demo login" is displayed, and SAML and other login methods are disabled, regardless of other settings. A
  demo warning is also displayed, indicating that the system is in demo mode. **PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS IN PRODUCTION.**
  This mode can't be used because of legal specification in this type of environment.

When this mode is activated, **it's not required** to verify the user account several times.

- **Platform Mode (Live)**: On the other hand, when demo mode is set to FALSE, profiles are generated based on
  individual user accounts inside the project. This offers a completely customized and secure Wi-Fi experience adapted
  to the interests and needs of each user. Users can set up accounts in production mode and use all available login
  methods, including SAML and Google authentication.

When this mode is activated, **it's required** to verify the account every time the user wants to download a profile
again, because it's a new demo account being generated on the portal.

## üîß Environment Variables

The OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal utilizes environment variables for its configuration.
Below is an overview of the different variables and their functions:

- `APP_ENV`: This sets the environment mode for the Symfony application. It can be `dev` or `prod`.
- `APP_SECRET`: This is the application secret used by Symfony for encrypting cookies and generating CSRF tokens.
- `DATABASE_URL`: This is the connection string for the primary MySQL database. It should be in the
  format `mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`.
- `DATABASE_FREERADIUS_URL`: This is the connection string for the FreeRADIUS MySQL database, used for RADIUS related
  operations. It should be in the format `mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`.
- `MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN`: This defines the transport (e.g., AMQP, Doctrine, etc.) that Symfony Messenger will use for
  dispatching messages. The value `doctrine://default?auto_setup=0` uses Doctrine DBAL with auto setup disabled.
- `MAILER_DSN`: This specifies the method of transport used to send emails with the Symfony Mailer component.
  Examples:
    ```dotenv
    # This are just a examples, please DO NOT USE IT
    # Example 1: Sending emails via SMTP (e.g., Gmail)
    MAILER_DSN=smtp://user:password@smtp.gmail.com:587?encryption=tls&auth_mode=login

    # Example 2: Using the default email transport (using PHP's mail() function)
    MAILER_DSN=mail://default
    ```
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: Entity of sends the emails to the users
- `SENDER_NAME`: Entity sender name
- `BUDGETSMS_API_URL`: This env manages the budget SMS link of the API, is not necessary to change this env.
- `EXPORT_USERS`: This env manages the operation to export all the **User table** content, this is disabled by default
  for
  legal and security reasons.
- `EXPORT_FREERADIUS_STATISTICS`: Manages the export of FreeRADIUS statistics from the admin page.

These two envs are for debugging purposes, they only should be used to control and manage reports from the portal.
`SENTRY_DSN`& `TRUSTED_PROXIES`.

### Google Authenticator Credentials

These credentials can be found on the Google Cloud Platform
by creating a new client_id & secret on the **credentials section**.

### üîí SAML Specific Settings

These variables are needed to set up the SAML Service Provider (SP) and Identity Provider (IdP):

- `SAML_IDP_ENTITY_ID`: This is the entity ID (URI) of the IdP.
- `SAML_IDP_SSO_URL`: This is the URL of the IdP's Single Sign-On (SSO) service.
- `SAML_IDP_X509_CERT`: This is the X509 certificate from the IdP, used for verifying SAML responses.
- `SAML_SP_ENTITY_ID`: This is the entity ID (URI) of the SP.
- `SAML_SP_ACS_URL`: This is the URL of the SP's Assertion Consumer Service (ACS), which processes SAML assertions from
  the IdP.

**Important**:
If you want to use this provider authentication on the project,
make sure to expose a SAML attribute on your IDP named
`samlUuid`,
to expose a unique id of the SAML account.
This property it's required to authenticate users if one of them doesn't have an email defined on the IDP.

### üëæ Turnstile Integration

These last two are used to configure the Turnstile integration with the portal, to check and validate actual users.

- `TURNSTILE_KEY`: Stores the public key for Cloudflare Turnstile integration.

# How the Platform Works

## Main Page

### 1. Main Page Overview - Live Mode

![Main_Page_Demo_False](assets/wba_screenshots/main_page_live_mode.png)

The main page in platform mode (**Live**) provides a user-friendly interface for users with
individual accounts.
The page welcomes visitors with a customisable banner that includes the company logo, welcome text,
and a brief summary of the portal's features.

Depending on the settings made by the administrator, users can log in using multiple authentication methods such as
SAML, Google, and Register authentication.
The main page provides a smooth and customized experience, allowing users to
safely and quickly connect to Wi-Fi networks.

### 1.2 Main Page Overview - Demo Mode

![Main_Page_Demo_True](assets/wba_screenshots/main_page_demo_mode.png)

The main page in platform mode (**Demo**) displays the platform's possibilities for users who want to
browse the portal without creating individual accounts.
The demo mode displays only the option for "demo login" on the
page, providing a simplified appearance.
To show the portal's key functions, SAML and other login methods are disabled,
allowing users to explore the system's functionalities using a demo profile built based on the given email.

Users are informed via a demo warning that the system is now in demo mode.

### 2. Verification Step

![Verification_Step](assets/wba_screenshots/verification_step.png)

The platform begins the verification procedure to validate the user after registration or when in demo mode. The
verification system sends an email or sms to the user's provided email or phone number address.
This procedure contains a unique verification link
or code that the user must click to complete the verification process.

The verification phase is a critical to validate the user's identity and makes sure their email or phone number
address is valid on the portal.
The user validates ownership of the email account and shows permission to use the OpenRoaming
Provisioning Portal by clicking the verification link or by submitting the code given on the email. This procedure
improves the platform's security by preventing unwanted access.

### 3. After Verification

![After_Verification](assets/wba_screenshots/after_verification.png)

After successfully completing the verification process, the user will be directed to this page.
The actions taken during the verification process depend on the mode in
which the user created their account.

#### 3.1 Live Mode

If the user created an account in live mode (platform mode set to **Live**), they will receive an email with
essential account information. The email includes a link to return to the verified portal, a verification code, and a
randomly generated password. With this information, the user can log in securely to the OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal.

#### 3.2 Demo Mode

Users who registered an account in demo mode (platform mode set to **Demo**) can access the verified portal instantly.
Because
demo mode allows users to explore the site without registering individual accounts, the verification procedure makes
sure that the user's session is safe.
Based on the submitted email, the system creates a demo profile that grants access
to the portal's features while keeping user data secure.

### 4. Download Profile

At the final stage of the process, users have the option to download a profile customized for their specific operating
system.
The OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal has intelligent auto-detection that identifies the type of device being
used.

When the user clicks the "Download" button, the portal generates a profile with information based on the user's account
information.
This profile is designed to improve the Wi-Fi experience by providing smooth connectivity and increased
security.

The downloaded profile includes all the essential settings and variables to make connecting to Wi-Fi networks easier.
The OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal improves Wi-Fi connectivity by giving a user-specific profile, making it easier and
more convenient for consumers and companies.

With this final step, users can effortlessly connect to Wi-Fi networks in various contexts, whether it's in public
hotspots, corporate networks, or events and conferences, experiencing the full benefits of the OpenRoaming Provisioning
Portal.
Say goodbye to manual login problems and enjoy a seamless, secure, and personalized Wi-Fi experience! üì∂üîíüåê

## Admin Dashboard Overview

The OpenRoaming Provisioning Portal also has an easy and intuitive admin interface, allowing administrators to easily
administer and customize the platform.
